## Requirements

1. n³
2. `has('nvim') || has('terminal')` i.e. terminal support
3. Optional `has('nvim-0.5') || has('popupwin')` for floating window
4. Optional n³ v4.3(+) needed for file-explorer mode

## Install

n³ must be installed. Instructions
[here](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Usage#installation).

Then install the plugin using your plugin manager:

```vim
" using vim-plug
Plug 'mcchrish/nnn.vim'
```

## Usage

### Picker

To open n³ as a file picker in vim/neovim, use the command `:NnnPicker` or the
key-binding `<leader>n`. The command accepts an optional path to open e.g.
`:NnnPicker path/to/somewhere`.

Run the plugin,
[select file(s)](https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/concepts#selection) and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd> to quit the n³ window. Now vim will open the first selected
file and add the remaining files to the arg list/buffer list.

Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on a file in n³ will pick any earlier selection (or
the hovered file if no selection exists) and exit n³.

### Explorer

To open n³ as a file-explorer use the command `:NnnExplorer`. The command
accepts optional path similar to `:NnnPicker`. In explorer mode pressing
<kbd>Enter</kbd> will pick a file but keep the n³ window open.

NOTE: In order to use explorer mode n³ version 4.3 (or above) must be
installed.

- - -

***NOTE:*** Pressing <kbd>l</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> on a file would open it
instead of picking. Use `-o` via [nnn#command](#command-override) to disable
this.

To discard selection and/or exit, press <kbd>q</kbd>.

#### `cd` on quit

Press <kbd>c-g</kbd> to quit n³ and `cd` into the last directory.


`set hidden` may be required for the floating windows to work.

For complete plugin documentation see `:help nnn`.

## Configuration

### Custom mappings

```vim
" Disable default mappings
let g:nnn#set_default_mappings = 0

" Set custom mappings
nnoremap <silent> <leader>nn :NnnPicker<CR>

" Switch away from file-explorer (assuming left sided) via <C-l>
autocmd FileType nnn tnoremap <nowait><buffer><silent> <C-l> <C-\><C-n><C-w>l

" Start n³ in the current file's directory
nnoremap <leader>n :NnnPicker %:p:h<CR>
```

### Layout

```vim
" Opens the n³ window in a split
let g:nnn#layout = 'new' " or vnew, tabnew etc.

" Or pass a dictionary with window size
let g:nnn#layout = { 'left': '~20%' } " or right, up, down

" Floating window. This is the default
let g:nnn#layout = { 'window': { 'width': 0.9, 'height': 0.6, 'highlight': 'Comment' } }
```

`g:nnn#explorer_layout` is same as `g:nnn#layout` but for the explorer mode.

### Action

It's possible to set extra key-bindings for opening files in various ways. No
default is set so that n³'s key-bindings are not overridden.

```vim
let g:nnn#action = {
      \ '<c-t>': 'tab split',
      \ '<c-s>': 'split',
      \ '<c-v>': 'vsplit' }
```

With the above example, when inside an n³ window, pressing <kbd>^T</kbd> will
open the selected file in a tab instead of the current window. <kbd>^X</kbd>
will open in a split an so on. Multi-selected files will be loaded in the buffer
list.

An example assigning a function to an action:

```vim
function! CdSelectedFile(lines)
    let dir = a:lines[-1]
    if filereadable(dir)
        let dir = fnamemodify(dir, ':h')
    endif
    execute 'cd' dir
endfunction

let g:nnn#action = { '<c-w>': function('CdSelectedFile') }
```

In this example, pressing <kbd>c-w</kbd> will select the file and `cd` into
its directory.

### Persistent session

n³ sessions can be used to remember the location when it is reopened.

```vim
" use the same n³ session within a vim session
let g:nnn#session = 'local'

" use the same n³ session everywhere (including outside vim)
let g:nnn#session = 'global'
```

Note: If desired, an n³ session can be disabled temporarily by passing
`session: 0` as an option to `nnn#pick()`.

### Command override

It's possible to override the default n³ command and add some extra program
options.

```vim
" to start n³ in detail mode:
let g:nnn#command = 'nnn -d'

" OR, to pass env variables
let g:nnn#command = 'NNN_TRASH=1 nnn -d'
```

### `nnn#pick()` and `nnn#explorer()`

The `nnn#pick([<dir>][,<opts>])` and `nnn#explorer([<dir>][,<opts>])` functions
can be called with a custom directory and additional options such as opening
file in splits or tabs. They are more configurable versions of the `:NnnPicker`
and `:NnnExplorer` commands.

```vim
call nnn#pick('~/some-directory', { 'edit': 'vertical split' })
" Then add custom mappings
```

`opts` can be:

- `edit` - type of window the select file will be open.
- `layout` - same as `g:nnn#layout` and overrides it if specified.

### Environment variables

n³ will detect env variables defined in `vimrc`.

```vim
let $NNN_TRASH=1
```

### Setup for `init.lua`

Use the same option names as you would in Vim script, e.g.:

```lua
local function copy_to_clipboard(lines)
	local joined_lines = table.concat(lines, "\n")
	vim.fn.setreg("+", joined_lines)
end

require("nnn").setup({
	command = "nnn -o -C",
	set_default_mappings = 0,
	replace_netrw = 1,
	action = {
		["<c-t>"] = "tab split",
		["<c-s>"] = "split",
		["<c-v>"] = "vsplit",
		["<c-o>"] = copy_to_clipboard,
	},
})
```

## Troubleshooting

These are some common problems that one might run into. Follow the instruction
and add relevant code snippet into your `vimrc` or `init.vim` to fix them.

* Files being renamed randomly: This can happen when using `AutoComplPop`
plugin.

```vim
function! AutoCmpNNN()
    call acp#disable()
    autocmd BufLeave <buffer> call acp#enable()
    autocmd BufEnter <buffer> call acp#disable()
endfunction
autocmd FileType nnn call AutoCmpNNN()
```

* Explorer buffer gets wiped when opening a file: This can happen when using
`miniBufExpl` plugin. The workaround is to make sure `miniBufExpl` is open
before calling `:NnnExplorer`.

```vim
let g:miniBufExplBuffersNeeded = 1
```
